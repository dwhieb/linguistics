* [**LangScape**](http://langscape.umd.edu/map.php)

  Langscape is a developing online resource for mapping, integrating and making discoverable a wide range of information about the world’s languages as well as for raising public awareness of language diversity. Langscape allows users with interests ranging from recreational to academic to discover the world’s languages via interactive tools and access to established research.

  Langscape currently provides location information for over 6,000 languages worldwide via an interactive map (using data from [Glottolog][Glottolog]). Additional resources for almost half of those languages are available through the map interface, including word lists, texts, recordings, sound inventories, and references.

  Langscape’s interactive map allows you zoom to any spot on the globe and see what languages are natively spoken there.
