## Resources

* [Algonquian Linguistic Atlas](https://www.atlas-ling.ca/)

  The goal of the project is to co-create an on-line, multimedia linguistic atlas of Algonquian languages. The creation of this atlas allows us to offer many training opportunities for sound editing and linguistic description training to Indigenous students. See also the [Algonquian Dictionaries Project](https://resources.atlas-ling.ca/).

* [**LangScape**](http://langscape.umd.edu/map.php)

  Langscape is a developing online resource for mapping, integrating and making discoverable a wide range of information about the world’s languages as well as for raising public awareness of language diversity. Langscape allows users with interests ranging from recreational to academic to discover the world’s languages via interactive tools and access to established research.

  Langscape currently provides location information for over 6,000 languages worldwide via an interactive map (using data from [Glottolog][Glottolog]). Additional resources for almost half of those languages are available through the map interface, including word lists, texts, recordings, sound inventories, and references.

  Langscape’s interactive map allows you zoom to any spot on the globe and see what languages are natively spoken there.

* [**Language Family Maps**](https://humans-who-read-grammars.blogspot.com/2019/10/language-family-maps.html)

  A blog post about maps of language families, at the [_Humans Who Read Grammars_][HumansWhoReadGrammars] blog.

* [**Native Land**](https://native-land.ca/)

  An interactive map of indigenous territories and languages of the world, though focused mostly on North America and to a lesser extent South America. Also has a very thorough list of resources on their [Resources page](https://native-land.ca/resources/).
