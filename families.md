# Language Families

This page contains resources relevant to specific language families.

## Algonquian

* [Algonquian Linguistic Atlas](https://www.atlas-ling.ca/)

  The goal of the project is to co-create an on-line, multimedia linguistic atlas of Algonquian languages. The creation of this atlas allows us to offer many training opportunities for sound editing and linguistic description training to Indigenous students. See also the [Algonquian Dictionaries Project](https://resources.atlas-ling.ca/).

* [Database of Algonquian Language Structures](https://alglang.net/)

  The Database of Algonquian Language Structures is a project to provide basic information about the sounds and grammar of the Algonquian languages in an easily searchable format. The database is currently in development and we are only in the early stages of adding data.

## Arabic

* [Database of Arabic Dialects](https://www.database-of-arabic-dialects.org/)

  The Database of Arabic Dialects (ضاد) is a project to collect the vast amount of published and unpublished data on Arabic dialects in a searchable electronic format. The project is aimed at researchers and students of the Arabic language. This website is the public interface to the database, and focuses on allowing for intuitive and controlled data input, and powerful data visualization. Data input relies on contributions from scholars in the field - user contributions are listed prominently on the website so that contributors can receive credit for their work. The interface will allow for control over data - not all data must be public, so users can take advantage of the features of the website even for private data that is part of a work in progress.

## Bantu

* [Comparative Bantu Online Dictionary](http://www.cbold.ish-lyon.cnrs.fr/) (CBOLD)

  The CBOLD project was started in 1994 by Larry Hyman and John Lowe to produce in Berkeley a lexicographic database to support and enhance the theoretical, descriptive, and historical linguistic study of the languages in the important Bantu family. The database includes a substantial list of reconstructed Proto-Bantu roots (based on Guthrie and Meeussen's reconstructions), several thousand additional reconstructed regional roots (called BLR 2 based on the current work of scholars in Tervuren and elsewhere), and reflexes of these roots for a substantial subset of the 500+ daughter languages. Published and unpublished dictionaries of selected Bantu languages have been scanned, converted to test, and entered into the database.

## Sino-Tibetan

* [Sino-Tibetan Etymological Dictionary & Thesaurus](https://stedt.berkeley.edu/) (STEDT)

  STEDT is a long-term linguistics research project at the University of California at Berkeley. It is directed by Professor James A. MATISOFF of Berkeley's Linguistics Department. Our goal is the publication of an etymological dictionary of Proto-Sino-Tibetan (PST), the ancestor language of the large Sino-Tibetan language family. This family includes Chinese, Tibetan, Burmese, and over 200 other languages spoken in South and Southeast Asia. The project was founded in 1987 and has enjoyed the support of the National Science Foundation and the National Endowment for the Humanities.

## Uralic

* [Typology of Negation in Ob-Ugric & Samoyedic](https://www.univie.ac.at/negation/projekt/short-en.html)

  The goal of the project is to examine, describe and provide a typological classification of the linguistic realizations of negation in a number of seriously endangered Samoyedic (Nenets, Enets, Selkup, Nganasan and Kamass, the latter extinct since the late 1980s) and Ob-Ugric minority languages (Khanty and Mansi), spoken in Europe and Siberia. These languages exhibit untypical and not well-documented negation constructions. The negation constructions will be classified applying current theories of linguistic typology so that the results will serve as a basis for further cross-linguistic comparison.
