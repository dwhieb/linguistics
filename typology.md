# Typological Databases

## [Atlas of Pidgin and Creole Language Structures](https://apics-online.info/) (<abbr>APiCS</abbr>)

The Atlas of Pidgin and Creole Language Structures (APiCS) provides expert-based information on 130 grammatical and lexical features of 76 pidgin and creole languages from around the world.

## [BivalTyp](https://bivaltyp.info/)

BivalTyp is a typological database of bivalent verbs and their encoding frames. As of 2020, the database presents data for 85 languages, mainly spoken in Northern Eurasia. The database is based on a questionnaire containing 130 predicates given in context. Language-particular encoding frames are identified based on the devices (such as cases, adpositions, and verbal indices) involved in encoding two predefined arguments of each predicate (e.g. ‘Peter’ and ‘the dog’ in ‘Peter is afraid of the dog’). In each language, one class of verbs is identified as transitive. The goal of the project is to explore the ways in which bivalent verbs can be split between the transitive and different intransitive valency classes.

## [Cross-Linguistic Linked Data](https://clld.org/datasets.html) (<abbr>CLLD</abbr>)

Datasets maintained by the CLLD project.

## [Database of Cross-linguistic Colexifications](https://clics.clld.org/) (CLICS)

CLICS³ is an online database of colexifications (polysemies or homophonies) in currently 3156 language varieties of the world.

## [Graz Database on Reduplication](http://reduplication.uni-graz.at/redup/)

## [Language Contact and Relatedness in the Hindukush Region](https://hindukush.ling.su.se/)

The goal of the project is to produce a typological profile of the languages spoken in the Hindu Kush Region, a mountainous area in north-eastern Afghanistan, northern Pakistan and the northern part of Indian Kashmir. The region is characterized by great linguistic diversity (more than 50 languages, including Indo-Aryan, Iranian, Nuristani, Tibeto- Burman, Turkic and the isolate Burushaski) and a high level of multilingualism. The region has served for centuries as a transit zone between different culture spheres and rival empires. Although a gold mine for the study of language contact and areal phenomena, political circumstances have made it largely unexplored and many questions are yet to be answered, e.g. how some of these languages are related and how they have come to influence one another.

## [Linguistic Survey of India](https://spraakbanken.gu.se/blogg/index.php/2020/09/01/griersons-linguistic-survey-of-india-as-open-access-digital-data-resource-for-studying-languages-of-south-asia/)

A digital version of Grierson’s and Konow’s “Linguistic Survey of India” as a free structured and enriched digital resource, is available online in several formats.

## [Metathesis in Language 2.0](https://metathesisinlanguage.osu.edu/)

The goal of this project is to provide a broad empirical basis for studying metathesis. This site has a browsable and searchable database of all reported cases of metathesis in the world's languages. Because many of these cases are controversial, we have chosen to be as inclusive as possible, and it is likely that some of the reported cases listed here are not true cases of metathesis. Our hope is that this project will facilitate future research on descriptions, explanations, theories, and typologies of metathesis.

## [Typology of Negation in Ob-Ugric & Samoyedic](https://www.univie.ac.at/negation/projekt/short-en.html)

  The goal of the project is to examine, describe and provide a typological classification of the linguistic realizations of negation in a number of seriously endangered Samoyedic (Nenets, Enets, Selkup, Nganasan and Kamass, the latter extinct since the late 1980s) and Ob-Ugric minority languages (Khanty and Mansi), spoken in Europe and Siberia. These languages exhibit untypical and not well-documented negation constructions. The negation constructions will be classified applying current theories of linguistic typology so that the results will serve as a basis for further cross-linguistic comparison.

## [Universals Archive](https://typo.uni-konstanz.de/archive/intro/)

Within the typology programme of the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft, 1996-2001, the remit of the project "Sprachbaupläne" was to collect and document linguistic universals that have been suggested in the relevant literature, in particular those of an implicational kind ("If a language has property [unit, category, rule, construction, pattern, ...] X, then it will also have Y"). The main result of this project is The Universals Archive, since 2002 maintained with the support of the Fachbereich Sprachwissenschaft of the Universität Konstanz.

## [World Atlas of Language Structures](https://wals.info/) (<abbr>WALS</abbr>)

The World Atlas of Language Structures (WALS) is a large database of structural (phonological, grammatical, lexical) properties of languages gathered from descriptive materials (such as reference grammars) by a team of 55 authors.

## [World Atlas of Transitivity Pairs](https://watp.ninjal.ac.jp/en/)

  The World Atlas of Transitivity Pairs (WATP) is a geo-typological database of morphologically related transitivity pairs such as ak-u ‘to open (intransitive)’: _ak-e-ru_ ‘to open (transitive)’ in Japanese, which participate in the causative alternation (_doa-ga aita_ [The door opened] vs. _Taro-ga doa-o aketa_ [Taro opened the door]). It consists of primary data from about 80 languages contributed by about 50 researchers, which can be downloaded for research purpose.

## [World Phonotactics Database](https://zenodo.org/record/815506#.XiH6kkuSnD5)

The website for this database is no longer online. However, this Zenodo repository contains a JSON database of the underlying data.

## [World Consonant Alternation Database](https://agricolamz.github.io/wcad/)

A database of consonant alternations in the world's languages.

## [World Writing System Database](https://agricolamz.github.io/wwsd/)

A database of the writing systems of the world.
