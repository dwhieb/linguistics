# Typological Databases

## [Atlas of Pidgin and Creole Language Structures](https://apics-online.info/) (APiCS)

The Atlas of Pidgin and Creole Language Structures (APiCS) provides expert-based information on 130 grammatical and lexical features of 76 pidgin and creole languages from around the world.

## [Cross-Linguistic Linked Data](https://clld.org/datasets.html) (CLLD)

Datasets maintained by the CLLD project.

## [Metathesis in Language 2.0](https://metathesisinlanguage.osu.edu/)

The goal of this project is to provide a broad empirical basis for studying metathesis. This site has a browsable and searchable database of all reported cases of metathesis in the world's languages. Because many of these cases are controversial, we have chosen to be as inclusive as possible, and it is likely that some of the reported cases listed here are not true cases of metathesis. Our hope is that this project will facilitate future research on descriptions, explanations, theories, and typologies of metathesis.

## [Universals Archive](https://typo.uni-konstanz.de/archive/intro/)

Within the typology programme of the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft, 1996-2001, the remit of the project "Sprachbaupläne" was to collect and document linguistic universals that have been suggested in the relevant literature, in particular those of an implicational kind ("If a language has property [unit, category, rule, construction, pattern, ...] X, then it will also have Y"). The main result of this project is The Universals Archive, since 2002 maintained with the support of the Fachbereich Sprachwissenschaft of the Universität Konstanz.

## [World Atlas of Language Structures](https://wals.info/) (WALS)

The World Atlas of Language Structures (WALS) is a large database of structural (phonological, grammatical, lexical) properties of languages gathered from descriptive materials (such as reference grammars) by a team of 55 authors.

## [World Phonotactics Database](https://zenodo.org/record/815506#.XiH6kkuSnD5)

The website for this database is no longer online. However, this Zenodo repository contains a JSON database of the underlying data.
