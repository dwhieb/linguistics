## [Atlas of Pidgin and Creole Language Structures](https://apics-online.info/) (APiCS)

The Atlas of Pidgin and Creole Language Structures (APiCS) provides expert-based information on 130 grammatical and lexical features of 76 pidgin and creole languages from around the world.

## [Cross-Linguistic Linked Data](https://clld.org/datasets.html) (CLLD)

Datasets maintained by the CLLD project.

## [Universals Archive](https://typo.uni-konstanz.de/archive/intro/)

Within the typology programme of the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft, 1996-2001, the remit of the project "Sprachbaupläne" was to collect and document linguistic universals that have been suggested in the relevant literature, in particular those of an implicational kind ("If a language has property [unit, category, rule, construction, pattern, ...] X, then it will also have Y"). The main result of this project is The Universals Archive, since 2002 maintained with the support of the Fachbereich Sprachwissenschaft of the Universität Konstanz.

## [World Atlas of Language Structures](https://wals.info/) (WALS)

The World Atlas of Language Structures (WALS) is a large database of structural (phonological, grammatical, lexical) properties of languages gathered from descriptive materials (such as reference grammars) by a team of 55 authors.

## [World Phonotactics Database](https://zenodo.org/record/815506#.XiH6kkuSnD5)

The website for this database is no longer online. However, this Zenodo repository contains a JSON database of the underlying data.
